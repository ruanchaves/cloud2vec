# Telegram bot usage

	COMMAND SYNTAX:
 
		/rec followed by a comma-separated list of artists.
	
	EXAMPLE:
 
		/rec Bob Marley, Metallica, Nirvana, Alice In Chains, Iron Maiden

	TIPS:
 
		Feel free to experiment but better results are expected if all artists after the first are 
		somewhat related between themselves and if the first artist is somewhat different from all others.

		You can submit up to 128 artists in a single command; all artists after the 128th will be ignored.
